- ðŸ‘‹ Hello Everyone !!! My name is Puriwat Sangrawee or You can call me Pongpang from Thailand
- I have a working background in Procurement & Manufacturing but now I am interested to learn more and more (and many more) in computer Programming
- From my previous experience as process engineer in one factory which I need to work with large amount of data but I found that many part of collected data were garbage or not to be synchronized properly / It also cannot be reproducible  which it results to difficulty of manipulation to be found at data user. From that point , I wonder whether we can manage & use it in a better way ? , from this simplest point pushed me to know about Data Science (and try to learn more and more until nowadays)
- Glad to know you all !! thank you very much
