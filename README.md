- ðŸ‘‹ Hello Everyone !!! My name is "Puriwat Sangrawee" or You can call me "Pongpang" from Thailand
- I graduated from Bachelor of Engineering (Polymer Engineering) from SUT Thailand with several years of working background in Procurement & Manufacturing Engineer but now I am interested to learn more and more (and many more) in computer Programming 
- From my previous experience as process engineer in one factory, I need to work with large amount of data but I found that many part of collected data in system would be garbage or not to be synchronized toghether properly. It also cannot be easily reproducible  which it results to difficulty of manipulation at data user. From that point , I wonder whether we can manage & use it in a better way ? , from this simplest point pushed me to know about Data Science (and try to learn more and more in that field & relavant field until nowadays)
- Glad to know you all !! thank you very much
